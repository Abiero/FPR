**Project Summary:**
Hi, 

I don&#39;t knew if it&#39;s right to put my project here, but let me summarise my project. 

I already developed a website https://LoveBitcoin.Cash (It&#39;s inspired by Awesome Bitcoin Cash GitHub repo, but now I have added lot more things then the repo)  to find BCH merchants or BCH related websites (which not only help community but also it&#39;s help in spreading Bitcoin Cash) . 

My website growing each day, I am planning to migrate my website to strong server because my website hosted on a shared web hosting. 

I am very weak financially, so I would like to know if you guys help me out to take my project to new levels. I am thinking about adding more things. 

Please ignore me if I put it into wrong section, also I am not bagging, I am just trying to get help. 

Twitter :- @LoveBitcoinCash 

Reddit :- u/LoveBitcoinCash 



**Resources:**
I might hire some writing people to right some helpful articles about Bitcoin Cash, BCH adoption, Why Bitcoin Cash etc. 

**Budget:**
I am looking around 0.5 to 1 BCH 

**Timeline:**
There will be no timeline, I will update my website with helpful resources about BCH everytime
 

**Goals:**
My goal is to reach more and more people online via my website, social media account, to spread knowledge about Bitcoin Cash. 

I will also work on finding new merchant who are somehow taking payments for there store item via any cryptocurrency &amp; i will educate them why they should start Accepting Bitcoin Cash.
