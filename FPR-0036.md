**Project Summary:**
Essentially this is a sustained, twitter based, social media campaign. 

The Bitcoin Cash Fund has a message to deliver to the world. It is a positive message about freedom and release from the confines of the old economy that has created such misery. 

It is also a commercial message that needs support in the so called first world. BCH must become foremost in peoples minds when they think about cryptocurrency and we want to help deliver the message in as many ways as possible. A good start, considering the price guideline, is a BCH focussed, twitter based, social campaign.

We have a twitter reach of over 100k followers over a number of mature twitter accounts that were built for business.

We want to deliver the BCH &amp; BCHF message of positive, genuine opportunity with a focus on BCH uptake in Australia but also around the world.

Social media reverberates in some unmeasurable ways and it is this factor that acts as a multiplier when the right media sparks a conversation. Word of mouth is still number one. 

With some excellent media resources at my disposal I can produce high quality material. Media in social has to be great for what ever reason. (story, image, offer, news) So much blank rubbish out there, so cut through is tactically worked through daily interaction. 

We work two phases, first managing and delivering posts. Second digging into the social arena and having actual conversations with people. Liking, following and engaging. This can really add to the message reverberating around the water cooler...

My team can create a sustained presence in social, enhanced with original content.

The language of BCH and indeed crypto currency is still mysterious and scary for people. This can change through sustained delivery of the message, brought into the vernacular in an entertaining manner. We can effect this change.

We can deliver this for you in our proposed BCH campaign. Daily output across the global audience. With a reach of 100,000,000 impressions of on point messaging monthly, many more people will know about BCH. 

We will also promote BCH through our new page on FB called The Social Media Society which is about contemporary Australian lifestyle, arts, culture and travel. Are becoming a social media society? What does that mean? How is the world changing? BCH is one thing that is about to change everything. 

BCH is a game changer for arts and culture too. It&#39;s an international currency that anyone can have right now. That has never happened before. If someone you know is broke on the other side of the world, you can buy them lunch or groceries or buy their art, immediately!

We understand the potential of the BCF initiative and know we can make a significant contribution.  

**Resources:**
Highly professional digital team. 

Complete range of required skills.

Concise core team with access to industry wide resources. 

Highly advanced social media strategy. 

Creation of engaging original content and deployment of the message on a daily basis. 

Significant social media assets always growing.

Our team has worked previously with the biggest brands on earth at head creative, talent and strategic levels. 

We would love to promote something this worthwhile.

This proposal is a twitter based social media campaign devoted solely to the promotion of Bitcoin Cash. Other social media channels like FB and YouTube will also be utilised. We have many resources to work with.  



**Budget:**
Budget $5000

20 day schedule four five day weeks. I calendar month of activity. Three to five month program so $5k per month ideally. 

We measure at six weeks. So three months would be ideal to really deliver results. If the BCH mini pos is launching in July we can create great awareness about the launch. Part of my team were the genius behind &#39;Lucy the Robot&#39; who famously bought the first iPhone 6s. This was a viral hit. 

Daily posts on FB and twitter. With a focus on twitter. We will retweet all social content in the discord relating to BCH creating a sustained broadcast in twitter especially. Plus create our own related content posts. We will also make interesting original content that delivers the message about BCH. 

Breakdown:

@tasplanetus strategy and creative .......... $1000
Social media manager                        ........... $1000

Content creation                                  ............ $1500

Post boosting                                        .............$1500

It&#39;s a very slender budget however it is money well spent we really know digital strategy and social media and can make a lot of noise about BCH with this level of funding. 

We can also scale to any level with our team having a long track record of working on the biggest brands and most successful ad campaigns on Earth. We would love to pitch a full campaign. Have one ready to rumble.  

**Timeline:**
Can begin immediately in fact have already delivered proof of concept with @bitcoinbucanee on twitter &quot;Bitcoin Bucaneer&quot; is a fictional character sailing the cyber seas in search of BCH treasure. He can r/t all social content promoting BCH with his humorous &#39;talk like a pirate&#39; commentary. Would really like to ramp that up. 

I have more mature twitter accounts that can be reskinned and some that can support the message by broadcasting to their current followers. When we built these lists we focussed on businesses and individuals that were active on twitter. The combined reach of these lists is potentially vast. 

The Bitcoin Cash initiative is a great message and well suited to this type of marketing and we would love to be part of this positive paradigm shifting moment in history.  

Four week campaign block. 

Twitter posts across all accounts reaching 100,000 mature active twitter handles... r/t and comments on initiatives plus original posts daily. 

50 tweets a day. With a reach of 100k followers across all accounts.... That&#39;s potentially 5 million impressions on twitter a day. 

Some days may more or less. If we aim for a range of 25 - 50 per day it is a range of 50 - 100 million impressions over the twenty active days in the month. 

Tweets run 247 so that number is higher. Fifty scheduled tweets daily on weekends. 

For 20 days there is live engagement (Mon - Fri x 4 weeks) as well as scheduled and live tweets. 

As long as the content is fresh twitter is happy with high volume. It&#39;s only two tweets an hour really...  

Each block is four weeks. We can begin work immediately. 

**Goals:**
Our clear goal is to make Bitcoin Cash and the mini pos launch in July a household discussion in Australia. 

Whilst targeting the local audience we also have substantial reach internationally through social media. 

The target number is to reach 1.1 million people actively involved the BCH conversation in three/five months. 

1.1 million people actively involved in the conversation from 
50 - 100 million impressions is a reasonable conversion rate of less than a few percent. 

With the interest in Crypto it could be much higher, much sooner. 

One aim is to create a hot, entertaining piece of content that sends the BCH message viral. 

To have BCH trending on twitter would be the ultimate goal of this campaign. (Aim high!)

**Other:**
In our estimation the Bitcoin Cash hard fork is a moment in history. 

BCH becoming available via a phone based txt message protocol changes everything. We would very much like to help promote BCH up to the launch of the Mini POS in July and beyond. 

We are ready to create press releases announcing significant Australian creative business entities accepting BCH. 

This phase is also about educating the audience. 

We know that most people know about crypto currency to the extent that they know the price crashed but it&#39;s worth something, some people have made millions, probably too risky... 

Communications are the most effective way to ally these fears whilst explaining the benefit, flexibility and value of BCH. Also, the simple pathway to participation. 

&quot;How to get started&quot; is one message that will be continuous because that is the biggest knowledge gap in the audience. 

Thank you for the opportunity to present this project. 

Look forward to your review of this proposal and I am available to answer any questions or provide more detail should it be required. 

Best regards,

@tasplanetus
