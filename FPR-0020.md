**Project Summary:**
What&#39;s more exciting than a little treasure hunt? The Bitcoin Cash treasure hunt initiative is underway as we speak. Members of the community will be able to design a unique paper wallet for the worldwide scavenger hunt. The wallet will have instructions designed to give beginners some background information about Bitcoin Cash, and a link to &quot;Findbitcoin.cash,&quot; which will have directions on how they can claim their funds. The site will serve a multitude of purposes. Firstly, it will host a map, where community members can hide wallets and provide geo-mapped clues as to where they are. Secondly, a resource for beginners to learn some basics of Bitcoin Cash. Lastly, it will provide links to resources in the community to expand their knowledge about the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem! We anticipate the site to be up and running in full functionality by the time next weeks update comes out.

**Resources:**
Build out the site - almost complete
Paper wallet - almost complete

**Budget:**
$1200 USD Broken down as follows:
- $100 USD will go towards the Hosting and Structural costs (which cost more than that)
- $100 USD will go towards supplies to kick it off in Toronto (ink, paper, ziplock seels, to protect wallets)
- $1000 USD to fund paper wallets to kick off the scavenger hunt
        - 100 wallets @ $1.00 each = $100
        - 30 wallets @ $5.00 each = $150
        - 10 wallets @ $10 each = $100
        - 4 wallets @ $25 each = $100
        - 1 wallet @ $50 = $50
        - $500 will go to various meetup organizers around the world to hide some wallets - organizers to be recommended by @monica


**Timeline:**
Kicking it off next week:
Initial wallets and clues will be hidden in: 
- Toronto, Canada
- Sprinfield, MA
- Buffalo, NY  
- West Palm Beach, FL
- Pensacola, FL

**Goals:**
