Audio, Writing, Voice over, and production will be done by me personally as volunteer work.  

**Timeline:**
Starting on 03/05/2018, taking roughly 5 weeks to complete. 1 week for writing, and storyboarding. 4 weeks for the production of the animation.

**Goals:**
Education of what Bitcoin Cash is, and what it is for. There are many misconceptions that the public has, and I believe this will help by reaching a large online audience.

**Other:**
The Bitcoin Cash Fund and myself both retain the right to freely use the video for educational purposes.
