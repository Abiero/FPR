# BCF Funding Proposal Request Template

**Project Name:**
Bitcoin Cash Rates WordPress Plugin

**FPR Id:**
0071

**Start Date:**
05/23/2018

**Hashtag:**
#bitcoincashplugins

**Name of BCF Gitter community room:**
#proj-bitcoinCashRatesWordPressPlugin

**Stakeholders:**
thebigblocks

**Project Summary:**
Plugin that displays current exchange rates for Bitcoin Cash using a shortcode. Option to include / not include currencies as desired

**Resources:**
PHP, WordPress

**Budget:**
It took approximately 1.66 hours to complete. I freelance at $40/hour so about $66 would be my time costs currently. I’d like to extend the functionality with new features, display options, scrollable “ticker-style” animation, color and style picker options, etc.

Excluding my existing time, I think I’d need about 12 more hours or $480 to complete all of my ideas. I think this will be a good project for the BCH community so I would complete for less too (just want to earn some BCH tbh)

**Timeline:**
I can start immediately and it should be done in under 2 weeks. I’d like to extend the functionality with new features, display options, scrollable “ticker-style” animation, color and style picker options, etc.

**Goals:**
My goal is to build a tool that allows anyone with a WordPress site and an interest in bitcoin cash to display and promote bitcoin cash prices to their website visitors. Shortcode use and varied display options will be available in page settings.

I’d like to extend the current functionality with new features, display options, scrollable “ticker-style” animation, color and style picker options, etc.

**Other:**
Current base version is available on my github
