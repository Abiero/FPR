**Resources:**
Web Plugin Developers
Connection with existing Radio/TV station like Bitcointalkradio
Cash for aggressive marketing to reach first target of 1Million crypto installs/users worldwide
Team (Graphic, Content writer etc.)

Dedicated Hosting/SSL/DDOS Protection = $7,500/year
Web Dictionary Plugin Premium = $55/year
iOS App (Year subscription and development kit/gadget) = $2,500
Developer/Graphics/Content Writing/Translation = $5,000
Marketing (including paid ads for install ads) = $10,000 (to reach first 10,000 - 1000,000 installs and users)

The fund is needed now already because we should have released the version1.1 for Android/iOS/Web already to aid more stable version but could not due to funding.

Total Amount required to fund this next Phase is $25,000 (Q1-Q2)


**Timeline:**
Q4, 2017 - Version 1.0 released (Android only) +53terms now updated to over 325 crypto terms and meaning

Q1-2, 2018 - Version2.0 released (Android/iOS,Web)+500-750Terms+Translation+ Aggressive marketing to increase installs/user base

Q3, 2018 - Version2.1 released (Android/iOS,Web)+1,000 Terms + Aggressive marketing to increase installs/user base

Q4, 2018 - Version 3.0 (Android/iOS,Web, PC)+1000above Terms +  Aggressive marketing to increase installs/user base

2019 and beyond continuous developments based on feedbacks.

**Goals:**
Reach: NewBies across crypto community worldwide

Reach Target: Minimum of 1Million Installs/Users on all platforms combined (Android/iOS/Web)

Why we want to reach Newbies?
It is because cryptocurrency community is still new and just getting main stream and mass adoption. Thus, alot of Newbies will find it hard to flow with the pro without access to crypto based dictionary to help with crypto jargon they are not familiar with in the fiat currency world. Also they need to be enlightened and informed of how crypto really works and also secure themselves while transacting in crypto. Some Pros have also found Version 1.0 released earlier to be useful tool for them too.

**Other:**
The sponsorship will have us brand the App with BCH promotion materials within the App, Blog and website.

But if full sponsorship for the next phase can not be shouldered via this fund, then a minimum of about $10,000 will be appreciated and you will be fixed as golden sponsor and still have the App branded with sponsors materials including yours.

We are looking forward to making the App not just Dictionary but one stop App for Crypto education by Newbies.

Thanks for supporting in making this project to continue to serve the crypto community FREE!
