**Project Summary:**
We at panda.exchange started an idea to do a series of giveaways for our users so they can get some coins. This idea started when the ZenCash core team offered us a giveaway (airdrop) for our users and it became a success. 

Our plan is to be the first exchange in Colombia and Venezuela to offer trading with BCH as the reference coin for all pairs on the platform. The idea is the for the Bitcoin Cash Fund to give our users a small amount of BCH to promote the launch of this feature and to help promote the use and adoption of BCH in the Latin American markets.

Users will be able to withdraw the BCH they receive from the platform and into their wallets or do whatever they want with the funds. We can track all the movements and we can email the users to notify them of the giveaway.

**Resources:**
We can provide all the other human and technical/material resources, aside from the BCH funds, needed to complete the giveaway. Panda.exchange has been operating for five weeks with real cripto-to-cripto operations after a two-month&#39;s testing period. We have a complete team of 21 people, most of whom are from Venezuela, others in Colombia. There&#39;s already 3,500 users registered on the platform, 40% are Colombians, 45% are Venezuelans, and the other 15% from around the world.

For promoting we have pandanoticias.xyz, which is a news blog, and Panda Server, which we use to promote all the work we do with the Bitcoin Cash Fund, and we have a YouTube channel in Spanish, &quot;Hablando de Blockchain y Criptos&quot;, which we are already using for this as well.

We can enroll the support of the @BitcoinCashVE community in Venezuela, led by Bea one of the embassadors of the fund who is also part of our Panda team, and the @BitcoinCashCO community that we&#39;ve started to grow from the meetups in Colombia. There&#39;s also the telegram channel Bitcoin Cash Espa√±ol (@bccashes) which we could use to promote the giveaway.

**Budget:**
We think for 3 USD to 5 USD will be enough for each user at the moment we have 3500 user. all depend from the BitcoinCashfund


**Timeline:**
When the proposal is aproved we count how many user are at this moment and give away at this total users. one time ever.

We can develop a tool that allows the fund to track which Panda.exchange users have already received the giveaway and where the funds go once they leave the platform.

**Goals:**
- Impact the Colombian and venezuela people whit one real help 
- promote de use and adoption of BCH
- Show to the BTC lovers and user BCH is the real bitcoin
- Impact the people are ready use BTC and show the power of BCH
