**Project Summary:**
Festy is participating in the SXSW music tradeshow as a sponsor. We are hosting a festival themed booth with live acts supported by the Arts Council of Ireland. Attendees will collect their Festy wristband loaded with crypto and spend at our booth to receive a free pair of sunglasses to mimic a festival setting. The customer journey therefore simplifies crypto payments by allowing attendees to tap and pay.

We are calling on bitcoin cash to sponsor a giveaway of crypto with the wristbands.

**Resources:**
Funding

**Budget:**
We are open to the board of the BCF to define the scope of this giveaway.

Our booth runs from the 11th - 14th March. For example:

$5 giveaway to 1,000 people per day = $20,000 of Bitcoin cash

**Timeline:**
11th - 14th March in Austin, Texas for South by Southwest

**Goals:**
Promoting the use of contactless crypto wristbands integrated with bitcoin cash. There are tens of thousands of people in Austin for the conference. Festy are pitching to festival organisers and consumers of music events. Our goal is to bring crypto to music events worldwide.
