Digital Advertising Services  

There are four mobile digital ad companies in Toronto: Wild On Media, Smart Outdoor Advertising, Accent Media Corp., and Northern Data. I have a rate quote from Wild On Media that I will assume is an average market price. None of the other companies replied to my inquiry.  
  
Rates for Wild On Media: For advertising purposes $350/hour (minimum booking of 4 hours per day) For Major Event participation (eg. Pride Parade, Canada Day or Marathons) its $500/hour (minimum booking of 4 hours per day) For bookings longer than 48 hours we can offer you the Digital at $300 per hour for mass advertising and $400 per hour for major events.  
  
For a noon to 10pm service on July 1st this would cost $5000 CAD.  
  
Funding would be needed in advance to book the date. Likely needed by June 1st at the latest. Would need an amount for a deposit earlier (~April 15th) to secure that date as it will get booked early!


**Timeline:**
Late March or Early April - Setup relationship and reserve date/time with mobile advertising company.  
  
April/May - Prepare digital materials for social media and for the digital advertising truck. Get in contact with local news to get the story out.  

May/June - Confirm with mobile digital advertising service and provide digital media. Begin building buzz via social media. Get a photograph with the truck displaying the Bitcoin Cash media.   June – Advertise on Reddit, specifically on r/Toronto, and possibly Twitter as well. Organize Thunderclap campaign.  
  
June 30th – Thunderclap campaign end date + message blast.  
  
July 1st - Digital ads take to the streets!  
  

**Goals:**
Want to reach as many people as possible, especially the younger crowd. Hopefully leave an impression on hundreds of thousands of individuals.

Downtown Toronto has two large universities and a few smaller colleges full of young individuals. 

I want to reach a younger audience as I believe they are less resistant to exploring new technology, more likely to adopt it, and more likely to see the potential practical applications of it. Young people also have larger social circles in which the idea can spread. 




**Other:**
The proposed date for marijuana legalization in Canada (July 1st) falls on Canada Day. However, there have been rumours that this legalization date may be delayed by up to 2 months.  
  
If legalization occurs on Canada Day then the young crowd will be out in the city streets in full participation of the festivities. The individuals celebrating such an event are more likely to adopt a technology that ‘goes against the grain’.

Can probably figure out a better hashtag...not my forte.
