**Project Summary:**
About Georgia
I am an active crypto advocate and passionate about blockchain. I live in Georgia (former Soviet republic), which in recent years became a very welcoming place for crypto and mining activity. 
To give you an idea of the situation in the country I will site some very good recent articles, describing the general situation (no to be dependent only on my words):

About myself
I run I run a successful law firm, which is the only company here providing top class advocacy and lobbying services. Our client are Philip Morris Int., biggest Georgian producers, etc. If you would like to get more information about it here is the website:  ( www.igroupgeorgia.com ).
As said above I became very passionate about crypto and decided to direct myself to this business lately. I have a small mining project, it was my first step into this business. Now I decided to use my experience and knowledge to do something more. And for that purposes very recently I created a website/blog mybitcoin.ge - which is a news and information portal and I have big plans to expand and do various projects with it. But as you know everything needs support and especially financial support, so my resources are also limited. 
There are many websites in Georgia which start with &quot;my&quot; and it is one of the most popular name for it, driving huge amount of traffic (myhome.ge, mymarket.ge, myauto.ge, etc.). What I want to convey is that this domain is and will be very appealing to the locals and it has a lot of potential. 
Besides I have extensive connections with big miners, ICO projects and generally with the community here.
About my proposal
Recently I red about bitcoin cash meetups and I know you are promoting it very extensively. 
There is a huge interest in Georgian society in crypto and blockchain. There are no credible internet resources in Georgian language where people can get information about blockchain, cryptocurrency, news, etc. 
I would love to collaborate with your fund, hear your ideas and discuss a little more to elaborate particular project about it. 
I am not sure what kind of activities you usually support besides meetups, so its hard for me propose other than a meetup or conference. But the website/blog needs better website, more bloggers and resources to be able to spread the word, give more information and engage even more people.
I would gladly get into more detailed discussions with your fund in case you like the idea. 
In any case I am strongly committed to developing my portal and I will continue doing it with the resources and time I have. 

**Resources:**
Better website, more bloggers, etc. Hard to say more. Depends on the particular idea your fund would want to support. 

**Budget:**
Hard to say more. Depends on the particular idea your fund would want to support. 

**Timeline:**

Thousands can be reached. 
Why? - Because they want it desperately and dont have a platform to turn to.
