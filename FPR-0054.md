# BCF Funding Request Proposal 


**Project Name:** Give BCH Tips


**Start Date:** 10/04/2018


**Hashtag:** #TipMeBCH


**Name of BCF Chat room:** TipMeBCH


**Stakeholders:** 

Myself  
Web developer (Esthon's employee)  
Graphic designer (Jodey Cornwall - not affiliated with BCH)  

**Project Summary:** 

The GiveBCH.Tips will provide a fast and simple portal where users can create up to 100 BCH ready paper wallets for the purposes of tipping, handing out BCH at meetups or giving BCH gifts to friends and family. The portal will be a simplified fork of Bitcoinpaperwallet.com where the only option is a quantity of BCH wallets. The user will simply select the number of wallets they want  to make and the amount they want to load, and the website will output a zip file containing both a PDF of the paper wallets and a CSV file containing a list of all the addresses in use ready to import into Electron Cash to load the wallets all at once.
Each paper wallet will have the public and private QR codes as well as instructions on how to create a Bitcoin Cash wallet using the bitcoin.com app and will have spaces ready for the recording and storage of the 12 word mnemonic key. Different templates can be made available for different purposes including tip, gift, service payment etc.

**Goals:**

I want this project to make it extremely simple to create and print paper wallets for the purpose of tipping people in BCH. The idea is to enable people to carry paper wallets at all times and hand them out as needed.  
  
I want to see 100,000 paper wallets created in the first 12 months and used to tip service personnel, mechanics, to pay gardners, babysitters, whoever.  
  
BCH is for everyone so making it accessible to anyone is very important.  


**Other:**

It's awesome.
