# BCF Funding Proposal Request Template

**Project Name:**
Silent Bitcoin Disco

**FPR Id:**
0025

**Start Date:**
16.02.18

**Hashtag:**
#SilentBitcoinDisco

**Name of BCF Gitter community room:**
#proj-silentBitcoinDisco

**Stakeholders:**
We had an unreliable partner, we held the first event with 40 medium quality headphones together but the communication was not flowing, so i decided that we could invest in our own higher quality headphones and get it going alone.

**Project Summary:**
We want to hold Parties where people pay a minimum consumption of 5€.
They come to the party, they give us 5€ for each headphone, they get BCH in return.
If they do not have a smartphone, their phone is full, their battery is empty or they do not have data, we will offer them paper wallets which are worth exactly one drink! So they will be using bitcoin in any way!

But the main goal is to get people to download the wallet, we will offer wifi as well.

We can buy 100 Headphones which would be enough to start for about 3500€ but we would prefer to buy 200 headphones for about 6500€.

The DJ costs about 100€ per party, we split the profits of the drinks with the event host, we are trying to get art galleries as partners, so we can make silent bitcoin disco in large art galleries.

We could lend the money from BCF and pay back with interest rate, in general The Real Bitcoin Club wants to raise a ERC 20 token soon, giving out tokens at 75% of the price and we buy the tokens back in two steps after 1&amp;2 years.

**Resources:**
We need funding and many local partners to have different places to offer in different parts of Barcelona.

**Budget:**

**Timeline:**
The Party will be on the 31st of March!

We would have to order as soon as possible, as we can also get a custom design for the headphones, we could make the Bitcoin Logo on the side of the headphone, lighting up while people are dancing in the dark :)

**Goals:**
We want to reach the normal crowd, people who have never heard of bitcoin and have never used it, but which are young and social.

We want to reach 200 people each weekend! Once we have this party going on the evenings, we will offer after hour parties regularly, which are especially interesting as we have strict laws in Barcelona about the noise and it is soo hard to find any club after 6am.

So maybe we can reach 200 on a Saturday and 200 on a Sunday After Hour by the end of the year, each weekend! Because we are not charging any entrance fee, the party will be very popular and we earn enough to cover the cost!

We want to reach the youth, the younger the better but old enough to have some money to spend!

We want to spread usage by doing it, learning by doing is the only way!

We will also give out a merchant map app, so people can spend their BCH after the party in the city!
