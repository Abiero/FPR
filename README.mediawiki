People wishing to submit FPRs should first approach a BCF board member to discuss of their ideas. After initial discussion, they will be issued a FPR number that they will use all along of their project. After preparation of their FPRs, they will propose their FPR for acceptance by making a pull request to this repository.

Having a FPR listed here does not make it a formally accepted until its status becomes Final or Active.

The FPR process is based on the BIP process.
