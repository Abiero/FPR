**Stakeholders:**
No one yet, just an idea

**Project Summary:**
The hackathon is aimed at getting developers, designers, business whizzes and creatives to come up with use cases for BCH, like services and games for BCH, and actually develop a small demo in a short time span (say 36 hours, or a week).

The demos will be collected and submitted via the Bitcoin Cash Hackathon website.

Demos should be playable/usable.  The public can vote on all entries within a time period by paying/donating an amount of BCH from a unique address (lets say mininum 0.001 BCH) to the unique address of the projects.  Projects can keep all the donations.

The votes will be tallied and the top 10 will go towards a pitching/demo round which can be recorded in video for publication and promotion.

Viewers can live-donate BCH to indicate support for projects.

Finally, all top 10 entries will go to a panel of judges (devs, designers, business people in the BCH community, BCH crypto influencers).  The judges will announce what kind of qualities they are judging on, and then they will give scoring which will be averaged.  Then we will announce the final top 3 winners, first, second and third place, who will get a BCH seed money prize for developing their project further or marketing it.
