**Project Summary:**
I would like to create the documentary film The Distribution of Everything: A Film About Craig Wright (working title) of 10-15 minutes length featuring Craig Wright and his vision for a better world through cryptocurrency. This film elegantly promotes Bitcoin Cash by raising awareness for the need of a cryptocurrency that can scale. The film adheres to BBC broadcast production standards and can screen at international film festivals, at conferences, on TV and on social media to reach mainstream audiences who previously had little understanding of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Instead of being an explainer or image video, this film is a philosophical portrait of a man with a vision for a better world. 

The Distribution of Everything builds on my previous film projects The Blockchain and Us (2017, www.blockchain-documentary.com) and Digital Transformation (2018, www.digitaltransformation-film.com).

**Resources:**
Because this film features Craig Wright, I would need access to him for a to-camera interview (roughly 60 minutes) and action sequences (1-2 days). Ideally, filming would take place in London in May.

Apart from this, this project requires filmmaking skills and materials for preproduction, production, postproduction and marketing with a film crew. Networks for getting attention of the global press and for getting the film to screen at international film festivals are also necessary. All these resources exist with the filmmaker Manuel Stagars, who is making films about fintech and blockchain technology since 2015 (www.manuelstagars.com).

**Budget:**
1) Preproduction total	$3,200.00 
2a) Production personnel subtotal	$17,200.00 
2b) Production materials subtotal	$450.00 
2c) Production incidentals subtotal	$200.00 
2d) Production office subtotal	$1,200.00 
2) Production total	$19,050.00 
3a) Postproduction personnel subtotal	$7,825.00 
3b) Postproduction materials and processes subtotal	$1,450.00 
3) Postproduction total	$9,275.00 
4) Marketing total	$1,000.00 

Subtotal	$32,525.00 
Contingency (%) 0.20	$6,505.00 
Total	$39,030.00 

Preproduction and production budget available by 1 April 2018
Postproduction and marketing budget available by 1 May 2018

**Timeline:**
Preproduction: 1 April to 30 April 2018
Production: 1 May to 15 May 2018
Postproduction 15 May to 30 June 2018

**Goals:**
Whom this project reaches:

The primary audience consists of programmers, entrepreneurs, corporate decision makers and people who are already familiar with cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Cash, and Craig Wright. This audience is global, and they are experts in technology with an age bracket of 20 to 50 years and a gender mix of 75 percent male, 25 percent female.

The secondary audience includes people with an interest in technology and a passing knowledge of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. They avidly follow technology media and read tech blogs and the science sections in major publications, such as the Economist, the Financial Times, the New York Times, the Atlantic, or many others. Inadvertently, they have heard about the boom cryptocurrencies, but might have little knowledge of the underlying technology, its details, major players, and challenges like scaling. The secondary audience comprises of students, professionals, entrepreneurs, and others with an interest in global trends. The power of this film lies in occupying the mind space about cryptocurrencies of the secondary audience with a film that indirectly promotes Bitcoin Cash and Craig Wright as a thought leader.

The primary audience finds this film wherever it may play. For this audience, the film acts as a confirmation about Bitcoin Cash and Craig Wright as a central figure in the crypto space. Distributing this film widely on major VOD platforms and film festivals peaks the interest of the secondary audience and brings it into the conversation.

How many people I want to reach:

My film The Blockchain and Us (www.blockchain-documentary.com) has reached 400,000+ views with the English and German version. I expect the interview with Craig Wright to reach similar number of views in a short amount of time.

Where the people are I want to reach:

I expect a similar distribution of the audience like in my previous film The Blockchain and Us. The top ten countries on YouTube for this film are:

•	United States	
•	Canada	
•	United Kingdom	
•	Germany	
•	India	
•	Australia	
•	Netherlands	
•	Brazil	
•	Spain	
•	Switzerland

Why I want to reach them: See next paragraph.

**Other:**
My motivation for making this film (Director&#39;s statement):

Prior to being a filmmaker, I have been a senior researcher of Open Data and a tech entrepreneur who has mentored startups and students in the quest to launch their own technology projects. Becoming a filmmaker has shown me the power of this medium; it can truly inspire people to believe in new ideas and contribute positively to the lives of people. My films stimulate critical thinking and constructive dialog, without dwelling on technical details that might scare mainstream audiences away. This is the first step that helps people see the bigger picture to make a positive impact in the world. 

This film encourages viewers to learn. It starts a constructive conversation about the digital future that is most urgent and necessary. Through my previous films The Blockchain and Us and Digital Transformation, I have met experts in disruptive technology all around the world. Among them are outstanding individuals with a strong message and the power to inspire people around the world to take action for a better, more sustainable future. I hope Craig Wright will be on board for this project. To think big and imagine how we can improve the status quo is the purpose of this film and my main motivation to make it. I also believe this film will find a substantial audience. The observational format with a charismatic individual such as Craig strikes a chord with audiences, and the topic of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies is fascinating, urgent, and timely.
