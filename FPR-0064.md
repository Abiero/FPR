**Project Summary:**
The goal of this project is to promote and incentivize the adoption of BCH leveraging a sponsorship position through the BCF at a tattoo expo in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada. Through the sponsorship opportunity we can get mentions on 150 radio commercials, logo on 45 CTV commercials, logo on all posters, logo on 2000 business cards, logo and link on http://www.frederictontattooexpo.ca, VIP passes to Expo, mentions from the stage all weekend.  Pretty much any promotional material will reference the BCF. 
Through different adoption techniques we can introduce the attendees to many projects. For example, we can offer a treasure hunt to introduce individuals to the findbitcoincash project. We can highlight various projects like bchpizza &amp; eatbch directly at the booth.

**Resources:**
Advertising material, such as a tailored video or step-by-step guide to promote to vendors at the event.
Amazing people interaction skills :)
Maybe an extra hand, though I&#39;m sure I can get a volunteer no problem.

**Budget:**
-All prices in Canadian dollars-
Sponsorship: $800 ($920 taxes included)
Transportation: $100 (estimate)
Accommodation: $150-$300
BCH for attendees: ??? 


**Timeline:**
15/5/2018 - 1/3/2019 - Planning

25/3/2019 - Finalized

March. 29th, 30th and 31st of 2019 - Attend Expo

**Goals:**
Who: Our broad reach is the people of New Brunswick, Canada. Out specific reach is the attendees of the Fredericton Tattoo Expo of 2019.
Reach - How many: In 2018 there were between 1000-2000 individuals to attend the expo. That expo was in a smaller venue so my estimate is between 1500-3000 people for 2019.
Why: I attended the expo in March of 2018 as an artisan eliquid vendor. We were the only company there to accept cryptocurrency &amp; while nobody purchased any product with cryptocurrency, plenty of folks were incredibly interested in it. 
Many individuals in the body modification community are anti-authoritarian by nature. Many body modification artists in my area are &quot;unbanked&quot; (My piercing teacher hadn&#39;t had a bank account in over 10 years) and so the ability to accept psuedoanonymous peer-to-peer digital currency at a lower cost than traditional methods would provide a great advantage. I feel as if this is a niche community that would be very receptive of the project. 


**Other:**
There are many biker gangs in the area that also may take interest in this project. Whether or not this is a net positive or negative is to be seen.
