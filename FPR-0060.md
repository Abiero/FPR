**Goals:**
In africa the transport sysytem is very lucrative business but because of cartels and police curruption the stakeholders loose alot of money in the tune of billions every year. So am making something that will be beneficial to both the customers and the business owners. When you enter a bus you scan the code by the door then you send your payment to that address. Which goes to the bus owners address then at the end of the day the owner pays his driver and conductor straight to their own wallet
