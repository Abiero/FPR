**Project Summary:**
In this largely digital age, we will see more and more, the need for blockchain technology to provide immutable records, value transfers, identity and more.
 
Chainstamp (chainstamp.io) is putting blockchain technology to work, by providing digital timestamping services for individuals and enterprises. From legal documents and business filings to creative works (like song recordings) and other digital assets, we are providing a platform to create unforgeable  digital proofs.

Beyond timestamping services (which there are already competitors for) we hope to build the brand and the platform for other kinds of digital asset issuance and tracking as well as get involved in some more cutting edge opportunities like on chain atomic swaps.

**Goals:**
In this digital age, increasingly people and businesses need tools and services to give their digital files, photographs, recordings a permanent presence and record. 

Our first service is a timestamping notary service, which puts blockchain technology to work in a clear and simple way by providing a point in time evidence for digital files.

We aim to reach however not just crypto enthusiasts, but everyday people and enterprises that simply want to take advantage of what blockchains can do: provide publicly auditable records with near perfect security, and permanence without central authorities.

Our primary markets for this will be: 
Businesses: enterprises, law firms, compliance firms, and all firms doing business filings that want extra projections and evidence offered by blockchain tech.

People : this includes everyone using social networking, photographers, musicians and other creators that want to use our service to give extra weight, credibility or evidence of their works or information they see online.

Beyond our initial timestamping service we will continue to develop, research and deploy blockchain technologies in a way that is simple and easy to use by the masses with a focus on, on-chain technologies. Some of our current research is in on chain atomic swaps and drivechain technologies which can help bring on chain scaling and security to the cryptocurrency world. 

**Other:**
We really want to build a blockchain technology company, not just a single one off service, however we also strongly believe in getting technologies into the hands of people and putting them into use. Our first service has some competitors, but there is room for more (especially using Bitcoin Cash), and this gives us an opportunity to build our brand with a working service, gain traction and find out what the customer landscape is like. 

We aim to really build the company, hire people (full time if possible) and grow the company as a startup with a focus on technological innovation but also putting these technologies to work in clear and simple ways.

We strongly believe in on chain low fee cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin Cash that promote actual use. Aside from offering payment in Bitcoin Cash we expect to use the Bitcoin Cash blockchain as a primary source of truth and basis for all blockchain technologies we work on.
