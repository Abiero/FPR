**Project Summary:**
Tip Cash Tips is an idea to help increase the adoption and awareness of Bitcoin Cash. 

The concept is to make a simple physical way of tipping a service i.e. adding it to the payment of a meal, a barman, someone who helped you, anyone really…..via paper tips.

It is designed to be a simple and aesthetically pleasing form of easily tipping someone a small amount of Bitcoin Cash. Most paper wallets I&#39;m aware of look far too technical and don&#39;t break down the process well enough for new users to embrace. Someone who looks up generating a paper wallet is likely very different technically than someone who doesn&#39;t know about bitcoin and is given a paper tip (wallet).

Simplicity on the creation side and more importantly as simple as possible to understand on the receiving side.

Just keep a few empty paper tips in your wallet and then just send the desired amount at the time and hand the tip over. If you like you could preload say $5.00 tips up at home for extra convenience.

The idea is to be a totally free service. All mining fees to come off the tip amount as the receiver never knew exactly how much was tipped or if the exchange rate has changed by the time of claim etc.

Too many of the paper wallet services look like they are from yesteryear and can be intimidating to new users. For such small amounts as tips, I think we can abstract some of the complexity from the process.

**Resources:**
I have designed the paper tips, web design and logo already. These, of course, may alter with feedback.
I have purchased the domains TipCash.Tips and TipCashTips.com. 

I’m happy to run the social media side of things. Hopefully, with an advertising background, I can help get the message out there.

Skills required:
Front-end web developer to turn the design into a responsive website that works well on computers as well as mobile devices.

Backend developer to enable the secure creation of the public and private keys as well as the formatting of these QR codes into the more design orientated and branded QR codes.

With my limited tech knowledge, I assume that some open source code can be used to help with these processes like https://github.com/theantnest/bccaddress

Knowledge of secure web hosting for such a service.

Advice on other technical issues I may not be aware of for such a service.

**Budget:**
Front end development - volunteer?
Back end development - volunteer?
Secure Hosting - I can pay and maybe donations will cover that in the future?
SSL certificate - $200?
Custom QR code api - may not be required?  https://market.mashape.com/unitag/custom-qr-code/pricing
Web site translations - can be an organic process

Total required $200 with volunteers
Without volunteers I don’t have the knowledge to estimate the programming work required.

**Timeline:**
Designs already created.
Website could be live within two weeks I assume as it is reasonably simple?

**Goals:**
I want to initially reach advocates of Bitcoin Cash who in turn can be ‘on the ground’ spreading the awareness and adoption via the simple paper tipping process. 

I want to reach everyone and those in the service industries seem like an obvious great use case......it’s such a great vehicle for introducing new people to bitcoin……to receive something without the initial barrier of asking someone to set up a wallet on the phone etc. 

Hopefully, I’ve made the process simple and pleasing enough to create the desire to know more.

Let’s do this !  ;-)
