**Project Summary:**
Converting Perfume Bottle to Pay one time Model to Pay per use Model. We have made entire Demo Product ready. We can showcase pay per spray with Mobile Integration. It is next level of pay per use like Uber.

User can buy bottle at 1/10 cost from Airport or Kickstarter Projects. Eg. Zara Bottle is right now 200 USD. User can buy that bottle in 20 USD. 
Steps: User has to integrate his Bitcoin Cash Wallet to Bottle. Every time he will spray from Bottle. He has to pay in Bitcoin Cash. It will bring DAU/MAU for FMCG Industry. We have working Prototype ready for this idea. We are working on this idea with proper IoT integration then expand this idea to other FMCG products, which have cost more then 200 USD. Eg. Wine and Whishky bottles.


**Resources:**
We already have
1. Mobile Waller App Developers
2. Electronics Guys
3. System Architects and Designers
4. Crazy and Stupid people to take it forward.

**Budget:**
We need 1 Million Dollar to make it first Kickstart Project to sell 100k Bottles in Kickstarter with 20 USD Starting Price. Every spray will be charged with .001 Bitcoin Cash after that, when user will buy Bottle. We want to change world inventory model of Pay once to Pay if you like.

**Timeline:**
5 Days Crude Prototype with Casing, Gadgets
1 month Proper Presentable Prototype will be NID
5 Days to find Mass Manufactuer in China
15 Days preperation for Kick Starter Video, Marketing company and Media Hype 
1 Month Kick Starter Project



**Goals:**
Kickstarter User are best Users they Overlap with Crypto People
Setting Target of 100k Bottles 
Earning per Bottle would be 2 Million USD
Bitcoin Cash Earning would be 20 Million USD if all bottles are used till end.


**Other:**
It is under development. If you dont contribute. Right now we are ready with XRP integration with Perfume Bottle. If you demo. We can give you. 

No NDA or anything required. We want to change world like Roger Ver. 
We believe in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalist

Idea is not important or who gets credit. Important is to liberate society from burden of Banks, EMI, One time heavy cost or Products which are very expensive but never used more then once in month. All those products can be changed with our Perfume Bottle. It will be torch light to every developer on earth to think about.
